# ML_AI_Portfolio

**Introduction:**

Welcome to my ML/AI portfolio. In this respository, I plan to further develop my skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. These projects will explore supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, image processing, and many more skillsets. My hope in creating this portfolio is that, despite my lack of experience in a professional setting, I can showcase my knowledgebase and desire to continue learning in this field of study. 

I have my B.S. Mechanical Engineering  as well as my M.S. Mechanical Engineering from the University of Akron (Go Zips!). During my time as a graduate student I concentrated in AI/ML via coursework as well as my final literature review in which I wrote a MatLab code to employ reinforecment learning to achieve a faster, more reliable convergence in optimizing a vehicle suspension system. 

I hope that this repository can be beneficial for myself, my collaborators, and anyone that reads our work!
